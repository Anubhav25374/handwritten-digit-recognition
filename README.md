# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This project implements a handwritten digit recognition system using a neural network trained on the MNIST dataset. The model can predict digits (0–9) from both dataset images and self-written handwritten images.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

## Model Architecture
- Input: 28x28 grayscale images
- Hidden Layers: Dense layers with ReLU activation
- Output Layer: Softmax activation (10 classes)
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss Function: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy

## Features
- MNIST training
- Image preprocessing
- Noise removal
- Thresholding
- Self-written digit prediction
- Visualization
- Model evaluation

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Run all cells sequentially
3. Upload your handwritten image
4. Get prediction

## Dataset
- MNIST dataset (Keras built-in)

## Future Improvements
- CNN implementation
- Web app deployment
- Mobile app integration
- Real-time camera recognition
- Multi-digit recognition
